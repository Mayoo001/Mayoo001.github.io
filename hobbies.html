            <p> <h3>Running</h3>
                <br/>
                At the start of 2020 I started my running journey, at first I found incredibly difficult
                and a big commitment, in fact you could probably say I hated the activity. As I began to do 
                it more often it not only became easier but it also gave me a sense of freedom as 
                if my problems were just magically gone. Since then running has been my personal therapy 
                and actually helped me feel better and healthier. It has also led to other activities that 
                are meant for my well being.

            </p>

            <p> <h3>Weightlifting</h3> 
                <br/>
                Similar to running I began weighlifiting as a commitment to myself and my body. At first 
                just entering a gym was scary and intimidating but a friend really helped me get over the fear
                by coaching me through workouts. As I began to see progress this and experience growth this motivated
                me to become the best version of myself I could be. As I look back on my progress over the years it has
                made me extremely happy to see the improvements I have made for myself and the results of consistency and hardwork.
                For this reason weightlifting is currently my most prominent hobby and one that I will continue to do forever.

            <p> <h3>Skateboarding</h3> </p>
            <br/>
            Skateboarding is an individualistic pastime I have enjoyed from my teens. It has allowed me to learn how to form 
            communities around activities I like doing. Although I don't often skate anymore it really taught me about passion 
            and what we are capable of doing if we set our minds to it.<br/>
